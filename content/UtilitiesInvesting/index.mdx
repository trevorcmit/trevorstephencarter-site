## Introduction

The first ideas that come to mind when you hear the words 'sector investing' are likely one of the following:
focusing on tech stocks during the last decade's bull run, 
investing in oil companies,
targeting REITs for dividend income, 
or trying to capture the growth of some new, unicorn industry.
This may be the case for many investors, but for some, certain sectors have
much more nuanced uses. 

Utilities are not the most glamorous investments out there. Everyday conveniences
such as water, electricity, and gas are often taken for granted, both in daily life
and in the market.
