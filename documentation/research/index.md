My research interests lie at the intersection between fields. With an educational
background in Computer Science and Literature, I've cultivated tools for programming,
analysis, and inquiry to approach any subject with a unique lens and ability.

My goal is to bring cutting-edge advancements in Machine Learning and Data Science to fields
like the Humanities, Social Sciences, Biology, and the Earth sciences.
