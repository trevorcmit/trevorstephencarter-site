### What is Gatsby?

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.

### What are Gatsby themes?

[Gatsby themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes) are pre-built, installable packages for setting up a siteâ€™s default styling, components, plugins, and overall configuration. This allows developers to have a fully functional Gatsby site with just a few lines of code.

### What does a minimum setup look like?

A minimum setup requires only two files. A `package.json` and `gatsby-config.js`. That will get the site up and running but to take advantage of the theme you will want to add content. For more information please review the [docs](/docs/).

### Can Gatsby Theme Amsterdam be used alongside other themes?

Yes. Gatsby Theme Amsterdam can be installed alongside other themes.

### Why can't it do this, that or the other thing?

Gatsby Theme Amsterdam was designed to be a minimal and clean theme geared towards photographers, artists and other creative folks. If you have an idea for an enhancement or feature that fits within that vision please log a ticket on [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanwiemer/gatsby-theme-amsterdam) or better yet submit a pull request.
